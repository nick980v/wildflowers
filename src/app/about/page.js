            At Wild flowers, we believe in nurturing strong connections with our
            families beyond the weekly sessions. To support this, we offer
            ongoing communication through a friendly group chat forum, where
            parents and carers can ask questions, stay informed, and feel part
            of the community throughout the week. Details of upcoming sessions
            will be shared in advance, so families can feel prepared for the
            weather and activities.
