            At Wild flowers, we believe in nurturing strong connections with our
            families beyond the weekly sessions. To support this, we offer
            ongoing communication through a friendly group chat forum, where
            parents and carers can ask questions, stay informed, and feel part
            of the community throughout the week. Details of upcoming sessions
            will be shared in advance, so families can feel prepared for the
            weather and activities.

            Any exciting Wild flowers news or announcements will also be shared
            here first, giving our families early access to updates. Parents are
            warmly encouraged to share photos (with consent) and special moments
            from home, helping to extend the sense of connection and community
            that lies at the heart of Wildflowers.
